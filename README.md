# Goban for kids

A travel-friendly goban, stones, and box.

The idea is to have a small board that can be quickly printed and given as a gift to anyone interested in Go.

This is not a typical goban, as the stones have small indentations where they partially "sit." This design makes it obvious when a stone moves out of place and allows the board to withstand small movements without disturbing the stones.
